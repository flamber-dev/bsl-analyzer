//! Daemon-owned filesystem change hub.
//!
//! One [`notify`] watcher covers the workspace root recursively and folds raw
//! events into a bounded, typed accumulator keyed by canonical path. Consumers
//! (search today; diagnostics and graph later) each register a cursor and pull
//! the drift they have not yet seen, so a slow or restarting sink never
//! blast-radiuses the others.
//!
//! Reclamation is driven by the cursors: an entry is dropped once every live
//! cursor has advanced past it, so the capacity bounds only *undrained* in-flight
//! paths rather than growing for the daemon's whole lifetime.
//!
//! Two different things can force a reconcile, and they are kept apart because
//! they are owed by different people. If the event stream is lossy — the backend
//! dropped events before the hub saw them — nobody has the detail, so every live
//! cursor is told, exactly once, to reconcile with a full scan. If instead the cap
//! is reached, the accumulator is being held at whichever cursor stopped draining:
//! the detail is released by advancing THAT cursor, and only it is told. A
//! consumer keeping up therefore pays nothing for one that stopped — it keeps its
//! exact paths — and asks about health through its own cursor rather than through
//! a shared verdict somebody else's silence would spoil.

/// FSEvents: a single kernel stream watches whole subtrees, and `watch` does not extend
/// a running one. `fsevent::watch_inner` stops the stream, rebuilds it over the widened

/// stream's subtree, so arming it registers nothing new and pays a blind window for it —
/// and one arm per created directory turns a checkout of a large configuration into
/// thousands of blind windows over the very tree the hub exists to follow.
///
/// inotify: NOT recursive. `RecursiveMode::Recursive` is emulated — the backend walks
/// the tree and registers each directory separately, and a directory created later is
/// covered only once the backend has learnt of it from an event and registered it in
/// turn. So the arm here is what creates the registration, nothing is torn down to do
/// it, and skipping it would take away coverage rather than a redundancy. That is the

/// inotify would trade a wasted arm for silent blindness.
